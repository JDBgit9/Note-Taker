# Note-Taker
## Description
This was an assignment for the bootcamp to learn back end developing by creating an application that can be used to write, save, and delete notes.  
I learned how to install the npm and run the node module. The html and front end were already in place we just focused on bringing the page alive. 
through js and node. I created a server.js file to place the objects and call function in. I did an mpm  install to create a pack-lock.json file.  
After that was done i did all the proper installs to get this note taker to work.  An API and htmlroutes.js files were made to route the information. 
to the correct server.  The note taker that I created does have the proper function required for the assignment. it is able to write save and delete notes.
